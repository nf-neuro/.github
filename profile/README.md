Welcome to the [nf-neuro](https://nf-neuro.github.io) organization, developping **_open-source_
[Nextflow](https://nextflow.io) modules, workflows and plugins for neuroimaging** led by the
[SCIL team](https://scil-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Our goal is to **provide
_Nextflow DSL2_ optimized processing modules and workflows tailored to neuroimaging data**.

**[nf-neuro](https://nf-neuro.github.io/modules) aligns with the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) framework
to streamline the development of neuroimaging pipelines !**

- 👩‍💻 Check out the [documentation](https://nf-neuro.github.io/welcome).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>We're having temporary problems transferring the [nf-neuro](https://github.com/scilus/nf-neuro) to the organisation.
>They are causing unavailability issues to users of the `nf-core` command line, and impacting `cloning` and `forking`.
>Follow discussions [here](https://github.com/orgs/nf-neuro/discussions/1) for more information.
